# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and this
project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

A **Compatibility** section carries anything that changes how a wkhtmltopdf command line
behaves. If you are migrating, that is the section to read.

## [Unreleased]

Nothing released yet.

The binary converts one document: a URL, a local file or standard input, to a file or
standard output, with paper size, margins, orientation, backgrounds, stylesheets, headers
and footers. Options with no Chromium equivalent are accepted and warned about rather than
breaking a command line that uses them.

Several documents, covers and a table of contents are not built. Neither is most of the
option surface beyond what V0 needed.

### Compatibility

The option table has been reconciled against a real wkhtmltopdf 0.12.6.1. Three things
change how a command line is read, all of them towards what the real program does:

- **`--cookie-jar` is a global option**, not a per-object one. It was already global in
  wkhtmltopdf; only this table had it wrong.
- **`--redirect-delay` is gone.** It does not exist in 0.12.6.1, which answers it with
  `Unknown long argument`, and now so do we. It was accepted and ignored before.
- **Options are refused where wkhtmltopdf refuses them.** A global option must come before
  the first input; a table-of-contents option must follow a `toc` object; page options may
  still go anywhere. Command lines that real wkhtmltopdf rejects used to be accepted here,
  and a misplaced `--toc-header-text` silently attached itself to the preceding page. Our
  own options — `--timeout`, `--no-sandbox`, `--chromium-path`, `--chromium-arg`,
  `--dump-parse` — carry no such rule and may be written anywhere.
